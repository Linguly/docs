# Principles

1. Do not overthink, do not over engineer
    - It is an open-source project using the ecosystem and no-SQL to be easy for any change and update
    - Have a big picture and maintainability in mind but don't focus on them too much
1. Always document but just as much as required
1. Iterate, iterate, iterate
1. Collaborate, collaborate, collaborate
1. The simpler, the better
