## Just the Docs

### Image is not rendered in the final doc
Images may not be shown although you see them in a preview. It is likely because the paths are slightly different in the generated files and you might need to go one level back to the parent folder.
e.g. [check here](https://github.com/Linguly/docs/blob/main/docs/setup/how-to-setup.md?plain=1#L40)
