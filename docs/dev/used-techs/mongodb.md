# Mongodb for development

For most of our functionalities we are using Mongodb primarily.
To have an easy local setup similar to the deployed version, we recommend to use the free tier of [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas).
There you can simply create an account [here](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) and select the free tier.
Then create a connection url and update the `.env` file based on the Database instance you want to configure.
Create the DBs and collections as you need.


TODO:
    - add link to .env and more info about it
    - add link to the Database Instance information
