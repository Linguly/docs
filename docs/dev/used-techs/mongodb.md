# MongoDB

## Easy Modify/Monitor of live or local instances

An easy way to connect to live or local MongoDB instances is to use [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).
By just entering the connection URL you can view and edit all the entities.

In order to connect to the live instances hosted using Coolify:
- We need to first make the DB publicly available.
- Then by using the public URL we can access the DB
- **Don't** forget to disable the public access when it is not required anymore
